First I made the required package(using ros's message_generation tool) and scripts folder, and the python files in these scripts.
In commander file I simply made a publisher function and published the command(if valid) to a topic.
The subcriber listens to the command and and calls a function that determines the final direction(using state machine transitions) and calculates the final position of the bot.
Then the function calls another function puts the data into custom message bot_pose and prints the positiona nd direction, along with publishing the custom message.


The problem I faced was with creating the custom message that required making some extra modules, and quite a number of tweaks in the CMakeLists.txt and the .xml file to process and convert the custom message into python understandable.
Other than that the state machine wasn't very hard, just required some mapping using python dictionaries.
